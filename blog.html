						⌜18.01.2024 // Whats going on, 98? Again?!
						<br><br>
						Big thing coming, and its a new website, IBM terminal like, with a lot more information and details, Im really excited about it, I want to add a lot of interactive elements and easter eggs, like this 98 like version that you will be able to get by "updating".
						<br><br>
						Also it feels good knowing that there is no exams in upcoming days, the IT exams gave me tons of stress, while tasks with html and css were easy, php was painful, but now this being over, I will be able to work on the website and art mostly in peace and read books that I have, cant wait for one book I ordered, Monotone Blue.
					
					<hr class="hrblog">
					
						⌜01.01.2024 // New year is here!
						<br><br>
						Happy New Year everyone, I hope everything went and is still going good for you, as I said I will begin posting artworks that I made and I will try to be more active! Happy 2024.
					
					<hr class="hrblog">
					
						⌜14.12.2023 // Wow, some time passed⌟
						<br><br>
						Hey hey, *taps the mic*, is this still working? I hope so! Well, to anyone who really reads this, new year soon, crazy, a lot happened, but hey lets get to the website updates and other stuff!
						<br><br>
						On new year I want to start posting my artworks, at least one a month as I dont have a lot to show, I will post only 2D artworks, if you saw my voxel art, damn, you are lucky! I think about making music too, you can check out my (still empty) bandcamp account!
						<br><br>
						Another important thing is that I will try to be more active, not jsut a gremlin that shows it self when it brings new art.
						<br><br>
						So, see ya on Christmas and New Year!

						⌜09.08.2023 // Taking a brake⌟
						<br><br>
						Im taking a brake for a bit, I wont be posting art, I decided to remove my artworks for now too.
				
					<hr class="hrblog">
					
						⌜17.07.2023 // New stuff to look at!⌟
						<br><br>
						I added new categories for my art, now you can switch between them, altough its not the greatest method, it works!

					<hr class="hrblog">
					
						⌜27.06.2023 // Upcoming artworks and small changes⌟
						<br><br>
						I came to decision to display Voxel artworks as 3D artworks as it should always be.

					<hr class="hrblog">
					
						⌜16.06.2023 // All pages are finished⌟
						<br><br>
						After few long days of hard work I completed the website, to my surprise this version works pretty well on mobile devices, so thats nice, right now I will move to creating art and oh boy I have tons of ideas.
			
					<hr class="hrblog">
					
						⌜14.06.2023 // First entry⌟
						<br><br>
						WOW! Whats this? A blog? People still use these? Yap! And be ready for a lot of entries here, current media platforms are wonky, so its always good to have a backup.
						<br><br>
						Website got completely updated, new design, animations and overall better user experience.
